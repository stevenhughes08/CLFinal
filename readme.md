#Kalashnikov Clowns website
##A project for Code Louisville by Steven Hughes

This project utilizes the follow technology.

*The Bootstrap Framework: Grid, modal and carousel.
*Nav portion of the page used a JavaScript I wrote that changes the links to Russian on rollover.
*The Characters.html page uses a for each loop to iterate through the clowns.js file to dynamicly create the page content. The file that does this is called lister2.js.
*On the NavBar a JQuery file called controlsHide.js hides and reveals the moble menu which is calculated to appear in the center of the page. 
*The Hire Us page goes to a underconstruction page. 
*I am aware that the shows page is having some issues with the way the columns appear in the large or xl displays. However it is functional and justifys without issuein the moble site. The rest of the site is fully scalable and tested in Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera. 

Thank you
